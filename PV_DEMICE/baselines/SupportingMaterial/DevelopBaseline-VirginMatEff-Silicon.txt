Quartz-Silica to Metallurgical Grade (MG)-Si
"Depending on the quality of the raw materials used and the operational strategy and skills, the silicon yield as metallurgical silicon ranges from 80 to 90%, the balance resulting in silica fume [2]." This has 1 to 3% impurities.

Refining of MG-Si
Seimens process is 80% of Polysilicon tech as of 2014 with increasing share.
Cz process is 95% of Mono in 2016, with 5% being a Continuous-Cz process.
"Trichlorosilane HSiCl3 is prepared by hydrochlorination of metallurgical grade silicon in a fluidised bed reactor [1, 2, 4]: 
Si(s) + 3HCl = HSiCl3 + H2        (26) 
This reaction occurs at 350°C normally without a catalyst. A competing reaction is 
Si(s) + 4HCl = SiCl4 + 2H2        (27) 
contributing to the formation of unsuitable tetrachlorosilane in molar proportion of 10 to 20%."
"for  each  mole  of  Si  converted  to  polysilicon,  3  to  4  moles  are  converted  to  SiCl4,"
"The present market of fumed silica is about 60 000 MT measured in terms of silicon unit. This presently corresponds to three times the  output  of  polysilicon  in  2000."

Therefore, the yeild of silicon from quartz-silica seems to be:
(80% or 90%)*(1/3 or 1/4)
so Min = 0.8*0.25 = 0.2 or 20% yield
and Max = 0.9*0.33 = 0.3 or 30% yield
That is shockingly low. We will assume 20% in 1995, and 30% in 2020, with linear interpolation for now.
