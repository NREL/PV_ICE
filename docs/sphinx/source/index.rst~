Welcome to bifacialvf's documentation!
======================================

bifacialvf is a NREL supported tool that provides a set of functions and casses for simulating the performance of bifacial PV systems through view factor method. 

The intended audience ranges from PV performance researchers, Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) companies, installers, investors, consumers and analysts of the PV industry interested in predicting and evaluating bifacial photovoltaic systems. 

The source code for bifacial_radiance is hosted on `github
<https://github.com/NREL/bifacial_radiance>`_.

Please see the :ref:`installation` page for installation help.
